      There are four user types available. Here is a short description of each:
    </p>

    <%= content_tag :h3, 'Admins', id: 'admins' %>
    <p>
      One or two people responsible for the initial app setup and user
      management. They have the same abilities as
      <%= link_to 'reviewers', '#reviewers' %>, but they can also
      edit/remove other people's issues, tasks, comments, etc.
    </p>

    <%= content_tag :h3, 'Reviewers', id: 'reviewers' %>
    <p>
      Basically, the project managers. They can do some app setup like create
      Categories and Projects. However, their main responsibility is managing
      issues and tasks.
    </p>

    <%= content_tag :h3, 'Workers', id: 'workers' %>
    <p>
      The busy bees working on tasks. In addition, they can report issues and
      self-assign tasks.
    </p>

    <%= content_tag :h3, 'Reporters', id: 'reporters' %>
    <p>
      Everyone else can open issues, add comments, and see activity.
    </p>
